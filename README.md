# How-to-make-a-simple-dice-roll-program
here i have discussed how to make a program that will roll dice for you with random numbers chosen by the system
In this project of dice roll program , we learn some basic uses of 'tkinter' and random  in python.
This is a small and simple project just to make a good practice and clarity about these functions.
Here we have imported tkinter and random and created a root or window for program to run . The size and name is also determined and can be changed by user.
then we started making the dice design using some special symbols already defined in python for different faces of dice.
then coming to the part for making button to operate the dice, i created a fully customized button using the Button function . 
with some of these features i have tried making a dice roll program .

I hope you will like it!!!
